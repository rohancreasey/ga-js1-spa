## SPA to allow simple management of player lists

### Issue: 
My wife coordinates her school basketball program. Along with the 22 team coaches there is a lot of manual paperwork to complete around player registration and attendance, for every training session & match.

### Solution:
Simple app that could organise players into team lists, allow each coach to complete a simple attendance record direct from their phone for a given date.

### Initial thoughts:
- Attendance records - present (P), explained absence (EA) or unexplained absence (UA)
- selecting date pulls list of expected players
- coach need only access their own list

### Evolution
- Lists allow for updates throughout season (e.g. player moves to another team)
- List to include medial alerts
- Email notifications to coaches
- Trigger alert to coordinator upon unexplained absences
- Export lists & entries to Word/Excel
